# randflick

I often have trouble finding a movie to watch.
I want to pick something good, so I often scout certain 
rotten tomatoes websites that rank the best movies on various
streaming services. Then I'll scroll through the page without 
ever settling on something. My solution to my indecisiveness 
was to let fate decide. 

Randflick is a simple command line application that accepts the 
name of a streaming service, scrapes a website for what rotten tomatoes
considers the best movies for that service, and gives back a random
movie title. 




## Usage

Clone the repo and execute `lein run` in the root directory. 
The accepted streaming services are hbo, netflix, hulu, and disney.
